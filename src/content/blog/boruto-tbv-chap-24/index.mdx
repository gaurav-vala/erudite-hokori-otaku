## Introduction

It's that time of the month again! A new Boruto chapter was released early, featuring an awesome fight and some great strategic planning from Boruto, as we've come to expect. Overall, it was a great chapter and I think this arc has concluded. Ikemoto-sensei's chapter covers are going crazy—as a designer, I'm loving them!

## Boruto's Planning

The chapter starts with a conversation between Kawaki and Boruto, which I'm guessing is a flashback to their first real talk on the Hokage faces. Boruto really planned everything by giving Kawaki specific instructions, and Kawaki followed them perfectly. This whole strategy ended up working in their favor.

This again shows how Boruto can be creative with the Prescience information from Koji, using it to change the flow of possibilities. The genes of Minato and Naruto are definitely shining through!

## Kawaki vs. Jura

As expected, the Kawaki vs. Jura fight was a hit! Kawaki didn't give Jura any time to act, constantly leaping at him with one attack after another. Jura managed to deflect some attacks and took some good damage, but he kept using that dark material from his middle finger, which previously broke Boruto's sword. However, it wasn't as effective against Kawaki's rods.

This fight was a good mix of brute force and power. Jura used Tailed Beast Bombs, while Kawaki used his Isshiki abilities: shrinking, the cubes, and the best one—firing the beam through his Karma, which did massive damage to Jura. The fight choreography was really good, too. The way Kawaki used his rods was very expressive, with typical Ikemoto-sensei's paneling.

## He's Still at the Top

Jura was taking a heavy beating from Kawaki, especially after getting hit by the Karma beam. But instead of attacking back, Jura pulled out a book, as if he were referencing Kawaki's information from it. He then started talking to Kawaki about the same thing: love.

He was impressed by Kawaki but told him what he had noticed in humans—how Himawari got a power-up in a short time, how Kawaki's powers had changed, and Sarada’s power-up. He linked everything to love, seeing it as a reason for extraordinary evolution but also a weakness for humans.

Obviously, Kawaki doesn't care much, but this all shows just how powerful Jura is. At that moment, his wooden veins came out and in no time, they regenerated Jura completely, and he was back to his initial shape. This means Jura could have regenerated and beaten Kawaki at any time, but he didn't. My guess is this is his way of trying to understand and properly interact with humans.

## Fun Moments

I guess Ikemoto-sensei couldn't hold the serious tone for long. After quite a few chapters, we got some fun moments. They came at the end of the chapter, with Kawaki stepping on Konohamaru, which probably hurt a lot of readers, haha! My favorite moment was the smirk from Jura when he was talking to Hidari about how Kawaki praised him. I think sensei just recreated a meme there.

## Naruto is Alive!

No one else noticed what Jura did. He questioned what drives Kawaki's desperation, especially since Naruto is supposedly dead. The answer to this question led Jura to the point that Naruto is alive, and with Kawaki's reaction, he confirmed it.

This shows that Jura is not only powerful but also very smart and is increasing his understanding of this world. What he does with this information remains to be seen.

## Koji's Concern Over Future Changes

This was an obvious development. Boruto using his methods to manipulate events was bound to change the future. For Koji, Kawaki was a variable he didn't expect to go against Jura. Since that happened, he's gotten a new chain of events while the ones he saw are changing.

This is interesting, as his ability can no longer be relied on as much as before. What he saw could be changed, and he’ll be blind when it comes to the future.

## Boruto's Control

One interesting thing in TBV Chapter 24 was Boruto's control over his Karma spread. It wasn't a proper control, but rather him trying to stay calm and not let it spread. He wasn't talking to Momoshiki either. It's like having a panic attack and trying to control it.

## Mamushi on the Move

In his update, Koji sees a fight between Mamushi and Daemon. This is going to be exciting since this might be the first time Daemon gets a proper battle.

The question is, how did Mamushi end up against Daemon? So far, he hasn't been part of any battle, even when the other Shinju lost. The only time he was in action was against Boruto, but now he’s moving toward his goal… Eida.

One thing I wished was for Boruto to have learned control during the time skip, but this is good too since we get to see firsthand how he does it!

## Conclusion

TBV Chapter 24 was great! It had good action, enough humor, and some future setup. This might be the end of the Sand Arc, and I'm looking forward to seeing what Mamushi will do, his fight with Daemon, and also how they will use the thorn bulbs to get Shikamaru and Moegi back.
