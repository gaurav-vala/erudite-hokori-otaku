It's that time of the month! New Boruto Chapter came, first thing i wanna say is, this chapter really had the thrills, and i really really loved it! Despite whatever people say, overall Ch 11 I felt was really fast paced. In whole chapter there were 2 fronts at where the fight was happening, and each location was given time, Shinjus specially Jura and Hidari are getting more interesting chap by chap. Also Konohamaru kinda shone through by saving himself (lol).

Boruto’s speed shocked Kawaki which was hilarious but that was to happen and then Shikadai acknowledging they are not competable to fight with shinju. Hima vs Jura was also good! Sarada vs Hidari ended quickly but well that's Sasuke’s Clone for you! Overall a real good Chapter with satisfactory moments and thrills i didn't expect in this way.

I'm not seeing any complaints this month which shows how the chapter was received by general audience! Can't wait for more!
