## chill house mix in sf

### Mayv

Imagine you are on a walk in your nearby park and you hear music is playing not something heavy or loud but some calm and cosy music, there are people laughing and talking about the music and getting to know eachother, that what I saw through this set, both songs and vibe are amazing and relaxing you'd be vibing in no time if you are into Chill Deep and melodic house music

## Bollywood Sunset Set at Lake Pichola (Udaipur)

### DJ NYK

This is the set that introduced me to this genre of music and made me see that something like this is possible, before this I didn't knew that we can take all the equipments and have a DJ SET at some place where no one would be expecting, I have been listening him for years I can't count and he's amazing as always! He created whole series out of it too!

## Deep House Forest Mix

### Durante

I found this set just recently, Durante is someone I know from AnjunaDeep Releases and his music is something that I come back to again and again. I found this set coincidently when I wanted something to listen to im Background, and I was playing it loud. Both my brother and mom enjoyed the set alot and they were both vibing the whole time.

## Boiler Room: London

### Fred Again...

There was a time I was listening to this set almost everyday, there is something about this set, the energy the music. This was my introduction to Fred Again... I guess that's the case for so many people. And after this his collaborations with Skrillex (who I'm really big fan of) made me realise that this dude is special and unique in his own way! There were so many unreleased songs which he released from time to time after but this whole set was special.... definitely....

## Live at Anjunadeep Open Air: Prague

### Ben Böhmer

Ben Böhmer is someone I found when I was exploring the Melodic House genre. This particular set isn't just visually chill but showcases his sound. Which is Unique in it's own way. This whole for me is his best songs, although yes there are other sets from him I like but my memory of when I heard this set makes it special for me!

## LIVE @ SZIGET 2024

### Martin Garrix

There are so many sets of Martin Garrix that I've listened to but somehow this set is the one that I come back to again and again since it was released. This set has so many mashups and I've listened to this set enough that even when I'm listening to the original songs somehow I think the mashup part will come but yeah that's how much I've listened to this set.
