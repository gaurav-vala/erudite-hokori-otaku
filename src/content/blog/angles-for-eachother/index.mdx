Angles for eachother, feels like one person giving hope to other person. Giving hope to someone who accepted their situation and put down everything, when these words are given to them. That life can be much more than what's going on currently.

Arijitâ€™s hindi verse which somewhat portrays same thing as his english verse. it's like a conversation between the one who has given up and one who is willing to go beyond if they both are together. As one verse says, there are moments to rise and moments to fall, ones who've seen through them know eachother well and they'll go through it again together.

It's all about how it was portrayed and that's where I was compelled on writing all that, it's my love and admiration for people who are involved in making this track come to life. Every time any foreign artist has done Collab with any indian artist it's either a Punjabi singer or any rapper, which in turn gives us something very generic and artificial.

Now every Indian or people who listen to him know on what caliber Arijit Singh operates and when I got know that he was in Amsterdam with Marty in his studio for 6,7 days and Marty explained how they vibed over their love for music I knew it wasn't going to be anything generic. And that's how I see Angles for Eachother coming to be.

Ever since the studio clip of them humming the melody was leaked it was stuck inside my head, it felt similar to when I heard Gravity which Martin debuted almost a year ago at Ultra. The melody and lyrics the vocal, everything stuck to me and it resonated with me. That was Gravity, although I still love the version he played at Ultra which is different from what was released, I love it!!

Coming to Angles for Eachother, the song structure is really a common one for progressive house tracks, you get beginning then the verse then build and drop, which is repeated with some variations in second part of the song. This what was different from any other time was the fact that Martin also sings a verse in it which also comes back at the end of the, I love that variation because it gives a lasting feeling the anything usual you'll hear.

Another part of happiness for me was Arijit singing in english, I mean he sings in Hindi, Gujarati and Bangali, those are the ones I can remember, and it shows his versatility. How great he is speaks from the fact that music producers don't even process his vocals! That's a rare one! Although I do feel like in Angles for Eachother he had some processing, because I have heard his raw vocals so I could differentiate. It all good though since the output was magical!!

In the credits I noticed usual collaborators of Martin and ones who I consider are responsible of making this song more beautiful, I can say that for Michael Zitron, Shaun Farrugia and Osrin..there are others involved but I know these people and they are great!
