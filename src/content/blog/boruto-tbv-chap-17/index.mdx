## Introduction

Okay! We are at that time of the month again! We have Boruto’s new chapter, so let me share my thoughts and try to get my head around things that are happening in the Two Blue Vortex Story.

I feel like all the transition chapters or these in-between chapters for Arcs are a bit weird. I mean previously, in Naruto Next generation these kind of chapters would come randomly but now we are seeing a pattern of when these chapters might come but also Ikemoto Sensei in unpredictable so we don’t know when we might get one of these chapters where you feel weird on how the story is moving forward and why certain characters are acting in certain way.

## Sarada’s feelings

So I did not think we might be in this again, but here it is. The chapter starts with Sarada thinking about the conversation she had with sumire. and obviously others are noticing it. obviously this is an important mission and they need to focus on their part. I don’t understand if this will affect how she performs during this mission. But having that conversation just before this important mission, Ikemoto sensei will not add those extra panels without any reasons.

## Yodo and Araya

Them having this type of conversation, it feels very typical no? Whenever one of the character is going to die you get to see them having a candid conversation. since the stacks are high for this mission, there is no chance of the any mistakes and that’s what all this setup feels like. Another reason is how Koji tells Boruto to not go in Battlefield. This all feels like a build up to something, everyone is expecting a death and this conversation of Yodo and Araya just feels like that.

## Matsuri’s Reaction

Konohamaru being a “Target” of Matsuri, this was not the reaction anyone would have expected. For Comparison Hidari when seeing Sarada, directly attacked with chidori. We also saw how Jura was finding his target naruto, he wasn’t as aggressive though he was curious to meet him and understand him. As Shikamaru said, they are like new born animal babies, who are working on their animal instincts. and I guess that’s what we are seeing here.

## 8th Hokage, Shikamaru Nara

This Scenario was somewhat necessary and I am glad Ikemoto sensei is differentiating between Naruto and Shikamaru as Hokage. I really got the vibe of what Tobirama would have been as a Hokage. This approach although is not what I thought Shikamaru would have taken, but as it was shown Koji through toad is guiding him.

Shikamaru describes Shinjus as Wild Beast Cubs, who don't really have their motives on point but they are acting up on their instincts, and that's how he is understanding why this approach is needed, although I feels like this fake approach of being friends and backstab will be new to the newer generations since they've never had to deal with life and death situation when dealing with enemy.

But all this is giving me a vibe that this is totally gonna backfire when Sarada and group tries to handle Ryu, dude already seems comfortable with his power, it's just that he is acting like a kid who's trusting anyone who is being good to him. And when he realises he was being playes obviously that'll make him more angry, to which Matsuri will also react aggresive and the way this team is acting up, besides Mitsuki I don't know anyone is on their full game, which obviously will affect how they handle uncertain situations. Maybe I'm overthinking but wel gotta see how all this playes out.

## Out of the game

Since the start of Two Blue Vortex, it seems Ikemoto is taking notes on what fans want to see, same in this instance we are seeing Boruto being out of battlefield. Which was something everyone wanted, to see the side characters shine and not Boruto takeaway the limelight, by coming in last moment.

This is Ideal situation which was built up before, according to Koji if Boruto enters this battle Jura will also act and he will kill Boruto. I guess looking at how Boruto handled Hidari, Jura might be on toes when dealing with Boruto. Again this is all setup to someone's death \*hopefully! And Boruto will have to just Sit and watch and he can do nothing about it.

## Kawaki and Amado!

I guess in next chapter we will see true potential of Kawaki. There was this question of how Kawaki will get powerup, there were many theories and it comes to this simple limiter being removed. It feels really simple to deal with, but problem with Kawaki is that he gets really irritating after any power up, so yeah obviously he's gonna do that now too. Will this be the true powers of Ishiki Ohtsusiki? That's what I'm curious about, because then Boruto will again have to do something to level that. Kawaki will definitely try to just handle everything without thinking when gets power up, that will cause problems to the plan Koji is working on.

## Conclusion

As this was last chapter of 2024, everyone thought there might be a cliffhanger or something but nah this chapter just a mild build up chapter, I'm seeing not many are liking this but I guess trusting on Ikemoto sensei and how he's maintained the pace of series so far in Two Blue Vortex, I trust him to make sense of everything soon.\\
