So we get to that time of the month! New Boruto Chapter is here! With a lot of story, revelations and sacrifices this month's chapter is amazing as always. Although it does feel like a transition chapter between arcs but also with a flashback it feels somewhat important!

## Hidden Sand Flashback

In last chapter we got to see the Shinju of Shinki who is named “ryu”, now in this chapter we get to see actually what happened. Where Gaara and Shinki’s team are against Matsuri, she says she ended up there chasing trail of Boruto. I guess her being part of Ten tails makes sense she could chase Boruto.

This scenario really puts forward that narrative of who to give preference, THE FUTURE Generation or THE IMPORTANT Person, Gaara makes sense on how they have to save the younglings but then Shinki makes sense with the ract that yeah, Gaara is someone really important to hidden sand.

In the end Shinki ends up getting devoured by the Claw Grimes, but he also seals Gaara. Something to be remembered here is that this isn't something similar to Kawaki sealing Naruto. That was a different dimention where time stops and Naruto will be in the same condition as he was when sealed.

Gaara however is sealed in a Iron Sand Ball created by Shinki so I guess they'll have to be fast on getting him out and treating him.
