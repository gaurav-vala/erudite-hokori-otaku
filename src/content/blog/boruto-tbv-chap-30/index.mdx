## Introduction

We are back with Boruto: TBV Chapter 30, and this month’s chapter was… quite something. It was funny and exciting; we finally get an answer to what Koji was worried about, and it seems everything was bound to happen. Team 10 almost had a "Captain America: Civil War" Lagos scene, and Kobu might finally get a taste of what an actual Shinju would do to him. There is a lot to unpack!

## Inexperienced Jinchuriki

Himawari made a total "newbie" move here. She should have known (from her fight with Jura) what kind of energy she was firing; it could have ended very badly. It feels like Kurama influenced her to use Tailed Beast Bombs, which is funny since he doesn't have Naruto there to hold him back this time. Himawari definitely learned her lesson the hard way.

I’ve seen some arguments regarding Shikadai’s reaction, but I don't see anything wrong with it. Himawari needs to understand the weight of her powers and the fact that she could have destroyed a whole section of the village beyond recovery. From my perspective, Shikadai’s "crashout" was completely fair.

## Daimyo Proxy

Kobu is clearly being set up as the obstacle for this arc, and he is doing a great job of it. The guy won't even move from his chair while commanding the entire village. It shows how restricted even a Hokage can be in this era, where it seems Hidden Villages are more dependent on the Daimyo than they were in Hiruzen’s day.

Kobu really got the better of Shikamaru this time. I feel like Shikamaru was too focused on one aspect and missed the possibility of Kobu pushing back. Honestly, the Shikamaru situation would have been the perfect opportunity for Ikemoto to bring back someone like Kakashi. It would have made sense for him to be involved in the plan. Even Shikadai would have been a better choice to lead; I don't quite understand the logic of giving Inojin the command, but either way, it worked out for Koji.

## Blind on the Battlefield

The Kobu situation at that exact moment made me curious about what happens next. Currently, everyone is flying blind. Boruto is stranded and told to wait for instructions; Delta and Sarada are watching the Mamushi cause chaos; and Team 10 and Kawaki are handling their own Mamushi. Clearly, one wrong move could lead to a worst-case scenario. The best part was watching Koji navigate through Shikamaru’s planning.

## Rationality over Ethics

The way Koji moved after Shikamaru was trapped by Kobu was both funny and exciting. Koji’s logic makes sense: in their current situation, they need to act based on necessity rather than worrying about right or wrong. Although things worked out in their favor (I’d like to think so), Koji using Inojin to put Kobu in that position was the best move. If Kobu dies, there are repercussions to deal with later, but if he is saved, he will finally understand the true threat the Mamushi and Shinju pose.

Knowing Kobu, however, he will definitely try to trap Shikamaru and the others by questioning how he ended up on that roof in the first place.

## Conclusion

Overall, it was a good chapter. It was a necessary, slower-paced transition that focused on the broader aspects of the invasion rather than just the fights. This is something I am really enjoying from Ikemoto-sensei in Two Blue Vortex. In Next Generations, there was a lack of focus on the side characters; here, we see how different teams handle a situation that affects the entire village. My only wish was to see more of the other teams from Boruto’s batch, but that’s just how Ikemoto works.
