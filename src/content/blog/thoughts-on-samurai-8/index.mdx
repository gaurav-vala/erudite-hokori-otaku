> **Written by MASASHI KISHIMOTO, Samurai 8.**

It stands somewhere between old school sci-fi category for me. Like it has the vintage Japanese vibes and then there are robotics and programs to handle stuff. Reminded me of somewhat Cowboy Bebop.

## Art

the art was done by “Akira Ōkubo”, and the story was written by Kishimoto. And in terms of Art, I'll say its top notch, like expressions, scale of galaxy, fight sequences, everything was done so on point. I also loved the character designs in Samurai 8, be it the main character Hachimaru or other supporting characters. Specially for Hachimaru, his design is just so cool!.

## Story

here comes my main issue with the Manga. It started off so well having to get us into this new world with all the different aspects of people living there. But then when the main plot point comes, it becomes so unstable in terms of what it wants to give us. For example, they would just put out one of the thing that was so hyped up until that moment, and you'll be left with that feeling of unsatisfaction. I guess they wanted it to be a bit long at first but then they just rushed it at the end to his finish the manga, (that's what I'm assuming) but i just hoped to see all these powerful characters they established to have a bit of moment!

_Overall it's a really good story with just 43 Chapters. Go on! Give it a try!_
