So we get to that time of the month! New Boruto Chapter is here! With a lot of story, revelations and sacrifices this month's chapter is amazing as always. Although it does feel like a transition chapter between arcs but also with a flashback it feels somewhat important!

## Hidden Sand Flashback

In last chapter we got to see the Shinju of Shinki who is named “ryu”, now in this chapter we get to see actually what happened. Where Gaara and Shinki’s team are against Matsuri, she says she ended up there chasing trail of Boruto. I guess her being part of Ten tails makes sense she could chase Boruto.

This scenario really puts forward that narrative of who to give preference, THE FUTURE Generation or THE IMPORTANT Person, Gaara makes sense on how they have to save the younglings but then Shinki makes sense with the ract that yeah, Gaara is someone really important to hidden sand.

In the end Shinki ends up getting devoured by the Claw Grimes, but he also seals Gaara. Something to be remembered here is that this isn't something similar to Kawaki sealing Naruto. That was a different dimention where time stops and Naruto will be in the same condition as he was when sealed.

Gaara however is sealed in a Iron Sand Ball created by Shinki so I guess they'll have to be fast on getting him out and treating him.

## Ryu

Okay Ryu is somewhat admiring and and shows he's the youngest in the group, calls everyone “elders”. As him being made from Shinki’s chakra, we see him able to manipulate the iron sand, same as his original self he's made the sand part of his body. Combined with Shinju powers and then Iron Sand he really is Invincible but then he announces his target, which is GAARA! Which also makes sense and as everyone said, funny enough he's the one with control over the Condition of Gaara so we gotta see how that plays out. Because out of every other target for other Shinjus the way they are capable Gaara might be the easiest to handle.

Personally I feel like his character design seems a bit over the edgy, with the pants and stuff, I guess for him it'll get time for me adjust.

## Code

Phew! Here we go….

So Ryu just after being alive senses Code who's watching the Shinjus from this cube in the center of their Hideout. Ryu uses the Iron sand and drags Code out like a mice. At this Point I don't know why Ikemoto kept him alive? I don't for moments like this! Lol! Right now Code is a character I just can't predict on what will happen to him.

Obviously him getting a power up is something we can say but then again even the new characters are coming and playing with him.

## Kawaki and Boruto

I didn't expect this type of Conversation happening between these two and that too this early in the Story. Well if you are building up to something then why not, and also the node to First Chapter of Boruto NNG is something we all picked up.

The way this chemistry between Boruto and Kawaki was setup, them working together makes sense. Obviously Kawaki wanna kill Boruto but also the fact that he's just too weak to stand up against even Claw grimes and He also acknowledged it that Jura doesn't consider him a threat. Someone who works with power of Ishhiki Ohtsusuki that is somewhat embarrassing and combining it all with the note from Ikemoto that yes we will get to see power up from Kawaki.

This Partnership will be something to look forward, but I am wondering how does that work? Boruto will have to share intel to lot of people through different channels so no one finds out that they all know everything! LOL it's weird!!

# Amado, the Sneaky Fox

I don't know what SAI is doing, like Amado is really looking at Kawaki almost all the time. There is the toad incident, also i guess almost everything because we get to know that he has that access to Kawaki’s vision! Creepy but makes sense.

We still don't know but yeah Kawaki is really important to Amado and he's doing everything to keep tab on him! Now the thing is What is Konoha Ambu doing when Amado is livestreaming Kawaki’s movements! Last i saw was Sai keeping eyes om him. After all that one thing is for sure….Amado is gonna do some crazy which is gonna mess up a lot of story. Question is when, now that Kawaki knows about his Limiters he will push Amado obviously which will not be a good chat, obviously.

## Conclusion

I'm taking this chapter as a transitional chapter so nothing more to expected but as always the story is unpredictable, atleast for me i can't guess where any of the character will go pr what they will do, which is the fun part of TWO BLUE VORTEX.
