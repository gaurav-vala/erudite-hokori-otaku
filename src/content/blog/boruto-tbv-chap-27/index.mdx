## Introduction

Okay! New month and we have a new chapter of _Boruto: Two Blue Vortex_! This chapter sets up a lot of stuff for the future, and I guess we are finally getting another attack on Konoha. This time it's Mamushi. Sumire did a “Tee Hee,” and Kawaki is back again for Amado’s throat.

This month's chapter was something I have been craving for the past few months, and finally, it's getting better again.

## Konoha Girlies

Okay, I know! This is getting to a level where it's unbearable to see these girls together, but the dialogue between these three is something to look into. Hopefully, Eida might survive the battle, but according to her, she is fine if the one killing her is either Sarada or Sumire. Obviously, Daemon will not let that happen, but maybe Ikemoto-sensei is onto something here? He has rarely wasted any dialogue (except a few times) for the sake of just showing emotions.

At some point, it gets cringey, but seeing Sarada speak out her genuine feelings is nice. I wish ChoCho was here; I feel like she was one of the characters who showed this emotion so well.

## Mamushi’s Ability

Koji reveals details about Mamushi’s ability. He can split into multiple solid clones, averaging about 20-30 clones. Considering how Mamushi beat the life out of Boruto in the first fight, this can get messy, but he is also a really good competitor for Daemon too.

There are weaknesses, of course. Poking his eyes—weird, but somehow it works? And also, he gets dumber as he makes clones, and this affects all of the clones too. There are a few questions to answer here, but that can wait.

## Inojin’s Moment

I didn't expect this, but somehow Inojin has become an important character in this arc. He is made to learn a new version of the Mind Transfer Jutsu and he's got some big motivation to work with: saving Himawari. Having that motivation in front of her brother is something! And Boruto didn't even flinch at that.

I'm just excited to see what this new jutsu can do. According to Koji, this jutsu will be very important in the battle against Mamushi, so I guess at some point Boruto and Inojin will teleport to the battlefield? Or maybe just Inojin.

## Kawaki’s Push

This was somewhat expected. Kawaki feels like he found a cheat code to getting power-ups, thinking he can just blackmail Amado to give him powers. But of course, he has that human body which can only be pushed to certain limitations. After that, he's gonna break; it reminds me of Midoriya (_My Hero Academia_).

Another question is: what type of powers will he get now even if Amado tries to give him one? A new Shinjutsu?

## Power-ups

This chapter reminded me of the moments we got in _Shippuden_—how even after the time skip, everyone had to get in their top performance just because the enemies were on that level. Right now, Inojin is working on a Jutsu, Sumire is working on an upgrade for Boruto’s sword, Sarada got the Mangekyo Sharingan, Himawari got Kurama, and Kawaki is pushing Amado for an upgrade.

This is good, and I guess this is something that needed to be done for this generation to be able to compete on the level of enemies we will get beyond Jura, because I just can’t see him as the endgame villain.

## Foresight Usage

Chapter 27 really showed the best way to use Koji’s Shinjutsu: getting Inojin to upgrade his Mind Transfer Jutsu and Boruto to get his blade upgrade through a technique that Sumire will develop in the future. These are things that I would expect to happen in a story where future sight is in the works.

Although, I do feel like at some point either Koji’s abilities will have to go, or Ikemoto-sensei will kill off his character (which I definitely don't want!). For now, this ability is utilized really well.

## Konoha as Battlefield

There is something conflicting in Koji’s sentence when he talks about Inojin’s new power-up. He develops it to avenge Himawari, which means Jura was involved. But right now, Mamushi came to Konoha, and Jura will not move until Hima or Boruto is involved.

Which means at some point in this timeline Jura will come, and Inojin will come to help. So either Boruto goes onto the battlefield again, or Himawari gets involved in Mamushi's fight somehow.

## Jutsus in Boruto

Well, we have Jutsus again in _Boruto_. I mean, they were always there, but blind audiences struggled to see them. Now we have Inojin learning an upgrade to Mind Transfer Jutsu and Boruto getting an upgrade to his “Uchiha Flowing Blade Jutsu: Hagoromo.”

I kept saying this: ever since _Two Blue Vortex_ started, Boruto has been heavily relying on Ninjutsu and Kenjutsu, but since there are no hand signs involved, low-braincell people are not considering them Jutsu.

## Sumire is not Special

If we go by Eida’s logic, people have given a thousand reasons why Sumire wasn't affected by Omnipotence, but in the end, it was as simple as her being good friends with Eida and Sarada. She's not special; she doesn't have any hidden ability.

People tend to find unnecessary depth in their favorite characters, which is what happened with Sumire. But the fact is, she's just a regular ninja who's hanging around with the right people.

## Condition to Omnipotence

According to Eida, she unconsciously excluded Sarada and Sumire from Omnipotence, and it made me wonder. There is just so much depth in that single moment where Kawaki pushed Eida to do the Omnipotence. She didn't have conscious control, but in the back of her mind, she ended up restricting it a lot!

I guess Shibai might have had total control over this, and he manipulated it heavily.

## Mamushi will not be easy

Whenever we are given the weaknesses beforehand, there is always going to be a catch. Mamushi has good strength; he is dumb on a certain level, but he can also be brutal if he knows his target. Konoha has not yet dealt with him. We have only seen him fight with Boruto once, and this time, since he is coming for Eida, his opponent will be Daemon. So far, Daemon has just scared the weaklings, so this is going to be a strength-vs-strength battle, and it's not going to be easy for Daemon, that's for sure.

## Conclusion

This chapter maintains the build-up of the last few chapters. They are not part of any specific arc yet, but they set up a few important moments that are necessary for future storylines. Ikemoto-sensei is tackling many storylines at once, and I'm loving that! Hopefully, they'll be justified properly one by one or resolved in one go!
