That time of the month again, and surely the arc that was starting to feel a bit slow has picked up once more! We’re getting one fight after another, and finally Kawaki is on the battlefield! Once again, we got to see Koji’s abilities combined with Boruto’s planning, which really helped him.

## Boruto vs. Jura

As expected, this matchup was pretty bad; and Boruto admits as much. The difference between their battle states is really visible: Jura is casually firing Bijū Bombs and experimenting on Boruto, while Boruto is struggling to keep up. He did manage to cut Jura’s leg, which impressed Jura more than it actually hurt him.

In terms of raw strength, Boruto is clearly at a disadvantage. I’d compare this to what happened with Sasuke against Isshiki; the difference is that Jura is doing it more gracefully.

## Team 7’s Mission

On the other hand, Konohamaru meets up with Mitsuki, who is carrying Sarada. He confirms that Araya has gone to the location where Shinki became a tree, and once again it’s mentioned that Yodo is dead.

Konohamaru continues to follow Boruto’s orders and acknowledges that Boruto saved him. He also trusts Boruto’s plan, knowing they need to stick to it in order to survive.

This growing trust could be the key for Konohamaru and Mitsuki to eventually break free from Omnipotence. Of course, they’ll need more resolve and almost blind faith in Boruto to accept that what their minds are telling them is false; but there’s a real chance that in the next arc, we’ll see both of them allying with Boruto.

## Koji’s Updates

We finally get to see Koji’s Ten Directions vision as it happens. Yes, the reel-like effect is still there, but it also looks like he’s possessed. He mentions that he got this update after six days. From the way it appears, Koji doesn’t seem to be in control of these visions; they just happen to him.

His reaction suggests that the course of events has changed drastically, most likely because of Kawaki’s sudden entry.

## Kawaki’s Entry

Kawaki’s entrance clearly surprised Koji, which seems to confirm that whatever Koji foresaw has now shifted. That may explain why he received these “updates.”

As for Kawaki himself, he definitely looks different. Every time he powers up, he has that aura of transformation. His outfit has changed, and the way he wields his weapons feels slightly different too; though I might be wrong since he’s mostly relied on Karma recently. Speaking of which, of course he started off using Karma again! It makes sense, but his dependency on it is insane.

That said, Kawaki is making excellent use of Isshiki’s Sukunahikona. This fight against Jura feels like a straight-up brute force battle, and Kawaki is well-suited for it. He can fight effectively at both close and long range, with sheer power backing him up. Boruto, by contrast, has relied more on ninjutsu. Against Jura, pure strength and resolve seem far more effective; both of which Kawaki has in abundance.

## Conclusion

This chapter was really good and well-paced, though I still felt like it wasn’t quite enough. Then again, Ikemoto-sensei seems to have everything carefully structured.

In the next chapter, the focus could shift entirely to Kawaki vs. Jura, or it might balance that fight while also showing how Shinki is brought back using Ryū’s Thorn Soul Bulb. Either way, I’m excited for what’s next. And the best part? We’re getting the next chapter on the 17th; three days earlier than usual!
