## Introduction

Okay! It's that time of the month again and wow! This month the chapter was so good! After all the build-up of the past 2 or 3 months, we are finally getting into the action. And not just Boruto—the way Eighth Hokage Shikamaru, Koji, and Inojin are shown... I just loved every page of it!

Of course, we'll dive into the highlights here, but we'll get into everything else one by one in this post and future posts as well!

## Upgrades are here!

Well, we got the upgrades already! Boruto got his new sword, which has a lot of upgrades now, including some scientific ninja-tool features. Visually, the hilt is mostly the same, but the sword has changed heavily in terms of its looks. It's a bit curved now compared to the previous one, and the sheath has also changed a lot. I guess Sasuke's sword has evolved quite a bit.

Inojin got quite an upgrade too, although with restrictions. He can cover more area efficiently than Ino, even detecting someone who can hide their chakra. This particular point needed to be covered since Otsutsukis are good at hiding their chakra. Also, the fact that Inojin can point out someone specific? There is a lot to talk about here.

## Chosen Few!

Using Inojin's new technique, Shikamaru picks out a few chosen ones! It's mostly Team 10 and Team 7. I wanna see if Moegi joins at some point, but the way Shikamaru handled this situation is what I loved seeing. He knew exactly what to talk about and gave precise directions.

From the way Shikamaru talked, it definitely felt like things are gonna get messy. But also, with Kobu being there to investigate, this might be the chance for them to show what kind of threat Konoha is facing.

## Invasion

Mamushi's invasion is kinda funny; he's calling others "bros" while his clone is talking about killing them! Jura’s love for Konoha was mentioned again. There are eight clones of Mamushi going around in Konoha, and Boruto already dealt with one. Slicing the eyes is the key here, but besides Boruto, how others will handle the brute force of Mamushi is what I'm looking for.

Of course, Konoha will be in a panic once everyone gets to know about Mamushi, but that also means Boruto's operation might be hindered. That's what I wanna see. Obviously, Boruto doesn't care about it, and I expect the same reaction he had with those citizens! It's gonna be fun.

## Conclusion

This chapter had good pacing with different levels of fights being built up currently. If this pace and action keep going, this might end up as my favorite arc of TBV so far! And we might finally see Daemon in action. Ikemoto-sensei knows it's that time already where Daemon needs to prove his arrogance.

As always, I'm excited for the next chapter! By the way, the Third Volume of TBV in English is out! I still have to buy Volume 2 and then 3, but damn, these things are expensive!
