## BACK STORY:

Kaina is the great snow sea, takes in a very different world, where whole sea is covered with snow, there are big trees which works same as islands where people make their kingdom.

There is also an uper layer called “Canopy” where also people used to live in villages, but now because of lack of water there are only 6,7 people left there.

The series mainly follows KAINA and RIRIHA, yes although the series is named after Kaina who lives on Canopy, RIRIHA who is princess of one of the kingdom from surface, plays key role on how Kaina goes in his journey to solve the issue of water.

## WORLD BUILDING:

Now here, from the way things ended in first ep i remembered Made In Abyss. Like how in there we don't know anything about the world but atleast we know that it's scary and anything could happen to you at any moment.

Same in Kaina, you are put in this world where there are so many uncertain things and with that comes opportunity of widening this world as far as ypu can imagine. So much potential there! And so much to look forward to!!

## ART:

Talking about art, at first i felt weird looking at how the character expressions were done, because most of the anime as far as I've seen is 3D CG, from environment to all characters, but with that also it has a very cinematic feeling to it.

Think of it as when you saw the Colossal Titan by mappa for first time, but you get used to it as you see more of it.

It's a new approach ( as far as I've seen ) but it works really well for the world!

## BGM:

In this department the studio nailed it on point, because music compliments the characters and scenary really well. As it gives a sense of the huge world that you are shown.

When i found the album on Spotify, i wasn't that shocked to see Hiroyuki Sawano ans Kohta Yamamoto as composers there, because these are the guys who know really well on how to compliment a story with big world building. For example, Attack on Titan and 86.
