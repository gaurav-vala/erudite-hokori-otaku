## Introduction

Okay! It's that time of the month and we got a new Boruto chapter. This time, it was a decent enough chapter with nothing much but calmness and peace after a big mission.

This is what I call a transition chapter—something Ikemoto-sensei has been doing after every arc is completed. It’s where nothing significant happens action-wise, but there are glimpses of what might come in the next arc.

## Sarada and Sumire

Yeah, well, this talk was going to happen and it finally did. Like others, I felt weird seeing them running holding hands, but well, what to say when there are a bunch of girls doing girl stuff? The funny part was Eida having a FOMO moment of her own.

I think after a certain point, even if they are pushing forward their feelings, it won't matter much as long as the stakes are high enough for them. And they both acknowledge it too; Boruto doesn't know about their feelings. From what I see, there is no love triangle, just two girls having feelings for the same guy.

## Himawari and Kurama

I was looking for an update on what Himawari is doing after her power awakening. And I guess she's doing the most "Naruto" thing ever: she's doing mind training with Kurama. I feel like this is the best thing that could have happened to her. Although the concepts Kurama is teaching her are still confusing, Kurama being her mentor with these powers is the best-case scenario.

If things continue like this, we can expect her to grow faster in terms of her control over Kurama’s chakra, and we might also see something similar to Naruto's Kurama Chakra Mode.

## Boruto and Momoshiki

This wasn't the way I expected Momoshiki to appear, but I think this is perfect. Momoshiki has given up on his plans to take over Boruto. Him sulking over his situation was surprising but made sense. What was more surprising was Boruto's offer: giving up his body in return for Momoshiki giving him powers to handle Jura.

But what comes after that? He's playing a big bet here, that's for sure. I am guessing he's betting on Kawaki and the others to be on a level where they can handle Borushiki at a certain point in the future.

## Depressed Villain

Momoshiki is back, and he's depressed! He was solely relying on the fact that Boruto might give up on himself after the Omnipotence, allowing Momoshiki to take over. However, since Boruto reacted otherwise and kept growing more powerful, that plan failed.

Momoshiki might be the first inner demon who doesn't want to live but has no option. He thought he was in control, but Boruto changing his fate cost him his only chance. The manga has previously shown his ego and how he looks down on humans. Now that he's trapped inside one—and without any control—it must be a depressing period for him. He has lost the will to live, but unfortunately for him, he can't do much about that either.

## Conclusion

This chapter wasn't much in terms of story progression, but it was all about tidying things up before the next arc starts. I know many readers will hate Sarada and Sumire running hand-in-hand; I hate it on some level too. I guess this is the official end of the Sand Arc, and we will see things moving in the next chapter.
