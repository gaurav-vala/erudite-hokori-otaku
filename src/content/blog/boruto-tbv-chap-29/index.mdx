## Introduction

Okay! It's that time of the month again! And this month the action continues, as most of the chapter focused on the battle that started in the last chapter.

The Jougan allegations are back! Weird as it is, it's something to look forward to. Team 10 and Kawaki are in action now, and Kobu is doing his thing (lol), so there is much to talk about here.

## Boruto and Momoshiki

The chapter continues from the conversation between Boruto and Momoshiki. The best part about this conversation was how fair it was. Because Boruto and Momoshiki’s minds are connected, they can't lie to each other. They can't plan anything behind each other's backs. So, there were parts where Momoshiki directly reacted to Boruto without him saying anything out loud.

Although, I still feel like Boruto giving him freedom will have a catch. Of course, Boruto won't put others at risk (something he regretted in the past when Momoshiki took over him) unless he truly trusts that they can beat Momoshiki without his help.

## Konoha Battle Mode

With Shikamaru's guidance, everything is working in sync. Little by little, Shikamaru is trying to control the Bug clones and manage how much they spread around Konoha, all while sitting in his office like a war general. It was good to see that.

It's funny how the sensory unit detected that “something” was off very late in the battle, meanwhile, Boruto is hopping around exterminating groups of Bug clones. Till now, they are successful in minimizing the damage, unless something drastic changes.

## Interrogation

Kobu is still interrogating Mitsuki, while Sai is also there. It is weird how some of the important people don't know what's going down in the city. I guess it's good for Shikamaru too—having no disturbance while dealing with a threat that these guys won't understand.

Of course, Konohamaru had to intervene trying to fix things and messed it all up; dude needs to chill and let things happen. Mitsuki is a better liar than Konohamaru! Well, since the Bug clones are revealed, I guess they can be distracted from the interrogation, and this'll give Shikamaru more time.

## Kawaki in Action

Kawaki is back on the battlefield, and this time he is more compliant with Shikamaru? That's a good thing; the dude understands he needs to cooperate with others when dealing with Shinjus. Also, his action in this chapter (as little as it was) looked clean! The way he conjured the staff and wielded it to deal with multiple clones was really good.

And the way his presence was shown—that was so cool! The Bug clones are standing there and _boom!_ Two chakra rods are instantly through a clone’s eyes! It was cool! Ikemoto-sensei is getting creative here, and I like it.

## Team 10 in Action

Team 10 gets in on the action as the Bug clones are close by. Himawari is the first to make contact with a clone. It’s good to see her confidently leading the way in the fight. I mean, when you have already dealt with Jura, Bug shouldn't be someone who will intimidate her. That makes me think her level of dealing with threats is likely above what others in Team 10 are handling.

Shikadai also used a version of Shadow Paralysis Jutsu? I don't remember him using this “Net Shadow Paralysis Jutsu” before. It's a good one too; he just pops the enemy from their location, which I am guessing makes them easier to handle since he can force the enemy to come to him.

## The Power Scale & Leadership

Beyond the physical clashes, this chapter dropped some major lore implications regarding Boruto's arsenal. Momoshiki has given full access of Karma to Boruto, and immediately Boruto used the Byakugan—and that too on a different level.

Now Boruto has _Inukai Takeru no Mikoto_, _Takamimusubi no Kami_, _Rasendan_, and everything Momoshiki uses too! He's nearly invincible at this point. The debate continues as Boruto used the Byakugan with full Karma access; some concluded the Jougan is just an anime-canon myth. I think it's just about time, and we will get it—not like this, but with a proper hint and hype moment for a plot change.

This also highlights Shikamaru's competence. Every Hokage got a new generation of Shinobi who are superior to their previous generations, and it's all about utilizing them efficiently. From Chapter 29, I can say Shikamaru has done the best work as a Hokage, handling the broken powers he got in his hands through Boruto's generation.

## Conclusion

The chapter ending felt abrupt. I mean, this particular scenario couldn't have a perfect stopping point for the chapter to end, so no complaints there, but it did feel a bit cliché. Inojin getting excited because the plan is going on track (WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T SAY!) raised a flag.

And then there is that panel of Koji with a mysterious look. As far as I have seen, this means he definitely is hiding something—a turning point that might mess up the plan. But of course, for him, the end goal is more important. We'll see how that comes around. Overall, a really good chapter and next month we continue!
