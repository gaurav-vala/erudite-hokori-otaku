## Introduction

It's that time of the month and we are back with a new arc-starting chapter! This chapter sets up a lot of storylines at the same time, even though they look minor at first!

Koji and Boruto are at it, saving the world while everyone else plays in the dark. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with the interrogation, but I'm also annoyed with all the politics Boruto and Koji will have to deal with now.

## Inojin Trapped

Okay, I didn't expect it to be so direct, but well… Inojin likes Himawari. There is a lot to unpack in that one sentence, and netizens are already making a big fuss about it. For me, I don't mind it at all; Ikemoto-sensei knows what he's doing, and after all these years, I trust him.

But, Inojin got trapped. Once everyone finds out he's missing, it's gonna get messy in Konoha. It seems Koji has plans for him, and it's visible that everything is going according to his plans again. In this arc, Inojin will play a good role.

## Shinjus with Feelings

The Shinjus are back at it with their exploration of emotions. Hidari seems curious about the different phases that Jura is going through. Mamushi, on the other hand, is in that teen “excitement” phase; bro is swiping through some interesting material.

Here again, Hidari and Jura are talking about human feelings—how Matsuri felt love and how that affected Jura. He is also determined to know more about love, which is a more complicated feeling for him too.

## Politics

We got a new character: Kobu, a personal assistant of sorts to the Daimyo. This shows how seriously the Daimyo is taking the Boruto situation. The main thing here is the mess created by Koji and Boruto that Shikamaru is having to deal with.

I love this because, in the era that Konoha is in, it makes sense that this type of bureaucracy exists. In Naruto's time, this wouldn't have been the case. But this also makes navigating the Divine Tree issue pretty difficult. Handling things on both sides—those who are determined to take Boruto and Koji down—is gonna be tough, and it makes for good scenarios.

## Konoha Girlies

Well, we are back at it! The topic of love comes up again, and this time it's discussed between the gossip trio of Konoha. Of course, Eida was interested in this talk; she's asking a lot of questions about Boruto, but then she drops the bomb.

Eida is smart, she observes everything. One thing I didn't understand is the need for Sarada to use her MS here. I guess she'll need some time to get used to it, but she definitely bombed. It was Shibai’s power vs. Uchiha power. People are gonna troll her, but of course, Daemon isn't someone to go down easily—we gotta see that more often though.

## Conclusion

This was a good chapter! I felt it was more of a build-up chapter, utilizing conversations in different places to set the stage for Mamushi attacking Konoha in one week.

I hope this time we get Daemon some proper competition because we have seen what Mamushi can do, and he made a mess of Boruto with speed and raw strength. This is gonna be interesting.
