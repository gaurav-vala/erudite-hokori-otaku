Let's get started with the banger of a chapter with sprinkles of little confusions! I mean too many things are going around in this one! Team 10 vs Jura is going as expected, they can't do anything against him obviously and Inojin’s desperation really got him obviously (typical anime style), but well that was a trigger for Hima so why not!!

Sarada vs Hidari!! Wass COOL AF, a little moment but so cool the way she instantly reacted, reminded me of the time Team 7 vs Boro happened, her first chidori and it's same spot she targeted! Her time skip growth is surely visible here. Hidari’s revelations will sure be a shock and impact moment for her. The Kurama and Hima’s conversation was really good too, and it shows Kurama is back with his old attitude with and he's not gonna treat hima like a kid, let her experience it all by herself and be there to guide, reminds of how jiraiya taught Naruto the summoning jutsu.

Overall a good chapter, gets the story flowing, of course there is too much to talk about. And we'll be waiting for new chapter as always!!
