I stumbled upon Ted through a reel, and I instantly knew he was that open-mouthed badass who says whatever comes to mind—sometimes a blatant asshole, but in the best, funniest way possible!

Massive appreciation for the VFX team because, aside from a few moments, I barely noticed that Ted was a fully CGI character. The way he interacts with others feels incredibly fluid, enhancing the overall experience.

Now, coming back to the show itself—it’s both hilarious and triggering at the same time! The sitcom format gives it an old-school charm, making you feel nostalgic while exploring a society that’s still growing. The characters are diverse, each bringing their own perspectives, which leads to some of the most unexpectedly funny moments. One minute, you're laughing, and the next, you're questioning what you just heard.

If you’re easily triggered or strongly attached to certain viewpoints, the show will definitely get under your skin. But I think that’s the whole point—to push boundaries and spark reactions. What makes it even better is the 90s setting, where people are trying to be more open-minded, yet classic stereotypes still exist. And the way those clichés get challenged? Absolutely hilarious!

If you're someone who’s open to different perspectives and doesn’t get offended easily, you’ll have a blast watching this. I really hope they continue the series!
